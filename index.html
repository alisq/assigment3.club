<h2>Assignment Three dot club</h2>

<p>Getting through isoloation by learning HTML & CSS</p>

<p>In the wake of the COVID-19, OCADU University has had to shift to online classes, leaving students in the lurch. Amidst them, Typography 3 students will not have the opportunity to develop their third assignment for the course. To compensate and to provide a learning resource for anyone at this time, instructors Chris Lange and Ali S. Qadeer will use this site as both an assignment and tool.</p>
