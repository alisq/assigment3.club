<p>In the wake of the COVID-19, OCADU University has had to shift to online classes, leaving students in the lurch. Amidst them, Typography 3 students will not have the opportunity to develop their third assignment for the course. To compensate and to provide a learning resource for anyone at this time, instructors Chris Lange and Ali S. Qadeer will use this site as both an assignment and tool.</p>

<h3>Let’s use this time to explore the possibility of HTML & CSS as a typographic medium. Through a series of exercises, we’ll learn the fundamentals of both syntaxes, practice and get comfortable with a way of making that is wholly different from what we’re used to (especially pertaining to typography), and collaborate a little here and there.
</h3>

<h4>Part 1: CSS Typeface</h4>

<p>To begin to get you comfortable with the use of code to create form, we will start with a drawing exercise. Create a typeface with only HTML and CSS. It should be a minimum of 26 characters. All characters should live on a single HTML page.
So we can re-deploy these forms in future work, ensure that all the DIVs you create use position:absolute within an assigned character div.</p>
<p>A typeface is a consistent formal system so think about things like scale, proportion, stroke, serif, angle, contrast, etc.</p>

<p>Examples: </p>

<h4>Part 2: HTML Typographic Poster</h4>

<p>Alongside traditional methods of web typesetting, deploy your CSS typeface on a single HTML page to create a web typographic poster. You can make anything you want: an event schedule, a large statement, a printed form. You decide.</p>
